        everyone meet Yoda! our perfect pet of the week, yoda was found when he was a little shy of a week two weeks old he fall down a roof and was abandoned by his mom but dont let that sad backstory distract you from the fact that yoda grew to be a gentle giant he is about a meter tall and likes to play with EVERYTHING just grab something tall and wave it and thats it Yoda will run toward you for play, now lets hear some facts about yoda, numbrt onr yoda doesnt know to hiss the farthest he will go when he is mad is to open his mouth  and do a sigh, number two everyday you have to hold and pet him while he pets you back by licking your arms. And thats it for out animal of the week hope you guys enjoyed getting to know yoda
